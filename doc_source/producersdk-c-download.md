# Step 1: Download the C Producer Library Code<a name="producersdk-c-download"></a>

In this section, you download the low\-level libraries\. For prerequisites and other details about this example, see [Using the C Producer Library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/producer-sdk-cpp.html)\.

1. Create a directory, and then clone the example source code from the GitHub repository\. 

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp 
   ```

   The C Producer Library code is stored in the `kinesis-video-c-producer` folder in [https://github\.com/awslabs/amazon\-kinesis\-video\-streams\-producer\-sdk\-cpp](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp)\.

1. Open the code in the integrated development environment \(IDE\) of your choice \(for example, [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)\)\.
